##  PopplerAttachmentSaveFunc:
##  @buf: (array length=count) (element-type guint8): buffer containing
##    bytes to be written.
##  @count: number of bytes in @buf.
##  @data: (closure): user data passed to poppler_attachment_save_to_callback()
##  @error: GError to set on error, or %NULL
##
##  Specifies the type of the function passed to
##  poppler_attachment_save_to_callback().  It is called once for each block of
##  bytes that is "written" by poppler_attachment_save_to_callback().  If
##  successful it should return %TRUE.  If an error occurs it should set
##  @error and return %FALSE, in which case poppler_attachment_save_to_callback()
##  will fail with the same error.
##
##  Returns: %TRUE if successful, %FALSE (with @error set) if failed.
